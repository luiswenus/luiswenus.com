      Experiments and things built by a curious mind during my youth

  <div class="post-content">
  <p>To those unfamiliar, the title is a twist on the title of one of my favorite books: &ldquo;Surely you&rsquo;re joking, Mr. Feynman!&rdquo;. The book is a collection of excerpts from the famous physicist Richard Feynman&rsquo;s life and mostly talks about experiments and things Feynman did by simply being curious and doing the things he found fun and interesting.</p>
<p>The start of the book about his youth resonates a lot with me, and by just being curious, I&rsquo;ve done everything from building bombs to making my own snow machine. This page is just to manifest some of the things I had fun building while growing up.</p>
<h3 id="the-snowmachine-that-gave-me-snow-before-anyone-else">The Snowmachine That Gave Me Snow Before Anyone Else</h3>
<p>I always loved the snow, and hated the part of the winter before the snow fell. We usually have around a month of this in Norway, and I desperately wanted to get snow in my garden before everyone else. Snowmachines obviously existed but were way out of my price range, so I had to build my own.</p>
<p>The principles were simple: blow air out at high speed, then add water to it, creating tiny water drops that would freeze before hitting the ground.</p>
<p>I tried many different designs until I found something that would work. The end design was simple, blow high-pressure air out of a small nozzle, and add some water to it through another tube.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/sketch.jpeg" alt="Sketch Snowmachine"  />
</p>
<p>This worked amazingly, and every year since I was 12, I had snow in my garden before everyone else. With this snow we would set up a PVC tube as a rail, and get a months practice in with our skis before the rest.</p>

</p>
<h3 id="the-smoke-bomb-that-activated-every-single-fire-alarm-at-home">The Smoke-bomb That Activated Every Single Fire Alarm At Home</h3>
<p>I had always been a bit of a pyromaniac. Every New Year&rsquo;s Eve, I would take apart fireworks and build more exciting things that would make louder and better bangs. The problem was that I was limited to the small quantities I could get from fireworks.</p>
<p>I did some research online and found that you could buy some of the ingredients for these fireworks off eBay. One of the main ingredients is Potassium Nitrate, a chemical that releases oxygen when it burns, causing a much stronger burn in whatever it burns with.</p>
<p>I bought a kilo of Potassium Nitrate from a Polish reseller off Ebay and prayed it would get through customs. When it arrived, I was ecstatic. I could make anything out of this!</p>
<p>I found out that if you melt the potassium nitrate together with sugar you could make crazy smoke bombs, releasing so much smoke that a batch the size of a ping-pong-ball would be seen by the whole neighborhood. One day I wanted to make the biggest smoke-bomb, I could possibly build, and used up most of my remaining potassium nitrate and started the melting process. Note all this was made in my small &ldquo;lab&rdquo; in the basement. When stirring, suddenly some of the batch landed on the very hot stove plate, it ignited immediately, and my entire batch, the size of probably 20 ping-pong balls, started burning. Within about 10 seconds, the entire house was filled with so much smoke that even in the room the furthest away from my lab you couldn&rsquo;t see your own hands.</p>
<p>This was when my mom told me the bombmaking had to stop.</p>
<h3 id="the-pocketbikes-from-the-landfill">The Pocketbikes From The Landfill</h3>
<p>One thing I was always passionate about was mechanics. I could take anything with a motor and fix it. One of the most fun refurbishments I did was some Pocketbikes we found on a landfill.
<img loading="lazy" src="/images/pocketbike.jpeg" alt="Pocketbike"  />
</p>
<p>The motors were basically rusty all the way through, and we had to take apart everything all the way down to the cylinder and polish it up. After a few days of cleanup and pulling the motor starting string for the 500th time, we finally made it work, and it&rsquo;s some of the most fun I&rsquo;ve ever had.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/pocketbike.gif" alt="Pocketbike"  />
</p>
<h3 id="the-rc-plane">The RC Plane</h3>
<p>I always loved radio-controlled stuff because you could basically build anything with it.</p>
<p>Back then, you could order parts from China for ridiculously low prices, and I used to buy servomotors for everything I wanted to build.</p>
<p>One of the cooler projects I did with this was building an RC plane out of construction foam. Most planes just didn&rsquo;t have the properties I wanted, they were either too big or small and then too fast. I wanted one that was small but could sail as well as the big ones. So I had to make my own one.</p>
<p>I carefully cut the construction foam, filing the edges with sand-paper to make the same curvatures you get on more professional RC planes. Once I had built the aircraft out of 3-4 different types of foam, I mounted all the servo motors in the right places, calibrated the plane, and went to test it. It flew perfectly! I&rsquo;ll admit this was beginner&rsquo;s luck, but I had a lot of fun with it.</p>
