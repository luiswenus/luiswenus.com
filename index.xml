      <description>After finishing my Africa trip, I had to go to university. With US universities being too expensive, the UK seemed like a good compromise. I ended up getting an offer from Imperial College London to study Mechanical Engineering, after flying from Barcelona to London to conduct my interview, already on my way driving to South Africa. I was thinking much more about the Africa trip than Mechanical Engineering at that time, so I&amp;rsquo;m glad I got in, and somehow even got a scholarship covering my tuition.</description>

      <description>Why? Growing up, I always loved adventuresâ€”anything from visiting old castles to climbing the fence of old military camps around Norway. I decided once I got my driving license: the ultimate freedom, I had to do some sort of crazy trip.
My criteria for this trip were:
It had to cost less than $5k It had to be to countries no one goes to, so I&amp;rsquo;d have cool stories Covering a considerable distance Ideally starting my drive from home I started reading about what trips &amp;ldquo;overlanders&amp;rdquo; (people who travel in 4x4 cars) were doing at the moment.</description>

      <description>The problem Growing up, I went to a state school, which meant mediocre education and unfirable teachers. I had my trouble with some teachers through the years, often because I either knew more than them or they were just inadequate at their job. I also had some incredible teachers who had such an impact on my life that I to this day have a deep interest in subjects they taught.</description>

      <description>I grew up in a family of four kids, which was already an expensive endeavor by my parents. We also had family abroad, and most extra money was spent on travel there. The mantra was always: you want money to spend, you need to earn it yourself. I was 14 and needed to make some money.
The idea I had already manifested from an early age that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to work for anyone.</description>

      <title>Surely You&#39;re Joking, Mr. Wenus!</title>

      <description>To those unfamiliar, the title is a twist on the title of one of my favorite books: &amp;ldquo;Surely you&amp;rsquo;re joking, Mr. Feynman!&amp;rdquo;. The book is a collection of excerpts from the famous physicist Richard Feynman&amp;rsquo;s life and mostly talks about experiments and things Feynman did by simply being curious and doing the things he found fun and interesting.
The start of the book about his youth resonates a lot with me, and by just being curious, I&amp;rsquo;ve done everything from building bombs to making my own snow machine.</description>
